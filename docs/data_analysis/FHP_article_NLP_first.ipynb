       "      <td>Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p &lt; 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: Forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture are common postural variants found in upper crossed syndrome, which can lead to limited neck mobility, respiratory problems, and other issues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p &lt; 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for the Rt.

Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P &lt; .05) and strategy scores (P &lt; .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P &lt; .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P &gt; .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.</td>\n",

       "0     Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p < 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.   \n",

The participants were assessed based on age, gender, dominant side, the amount of time they spent on their smartphones, the purpose of their use, and their posture. The Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Form (SAS-SF) was used to determine addictes and non-addicts. The cut-off value of SAS-SF is 31 and above for male and 33 and above for female.\\nResults: There were 136 participants in the study. The posture score for addicts and non-addicts ones was not significantly different (p > 0,05), but the number of trigger points, maximal bending posture and trigger points in the right levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles were significantly higher in the smartphone addict participants (p < 0,05).\\nConclusions: Smartphone addiction in university students is associated with postural changes and trigger points in the bilateral levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles. Public health programs should be developed to raise awareness about smartphone addiction, encourage screen breaks, and emphasize physical activity and exercise regularly.   \n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj < 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj < 0.05/4) for the Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD.

A total of sixty-six eligible participants with chronic neck pain and forward head posture were randomized into the Myofascial Release Therapy (MRT) group (n = 33) and MRT and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) group (n = 33). Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group. The difference in outcomes between the groups was statistically significant. Myofascial Release Therapy combined with CBT is an effective treatment method for patients with chronic neck pain and forward head posture.   \n",

Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P < .05) and strategy scores (P < .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P < .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P > .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.   \n",

This hypothesis is examined in the light of the clinical evidence provided by the symptomatology and treatment of 19 consecutive cases of intracranial mass lesions exhibiting truncal ataxia.   \n",

This lesion, untreated, may result in damage to the spinal cord, paresis or sudden death. Occipital headache, present in 13 of 22 patients, was often aggravated by working with the head in forward flexion. Paresthesias were present in six patients. The spine of the axis was often prominent. In three patients there was objective evidence of cord compression with sensory and/or pyramidal signs. In eight the lesion was asymptomatic and discovered by routine lateral radiography in flexion, the position of maximum subluxation.Conservative treatment involved the continuous use of a cervical collar to limit neck flexion.

Since positional nystagmus may be difficult to evoke and may be elicited at one time and not at another, it is important to make repeated tests, lest a causative lesion be overlooked. Vertigo in such cases may be caused by pathologic change in the eighth peripheral nerve or in the central vestibular pathways. Sometimes no organic disease is observable even though positional nystagmus validates a complaint of vertigo. In such instances the patient should be assured that he does not have a progressive disease and be advised against activity in which dizziness would be hazardous.   \n",

       "      <td>Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p &lt; 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.</td>\n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p &lt; 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for the Rt.

Conclusions: These findings suggest that the telerehabilitation training group, which included diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, was more effective in improving Rt.

Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group.

       "      <td>Objective: This study aimed to compare sensory organization test and postural control strategies between individuals with mild and moderate-to-severe forward head posture (FHP).\\nMethods: A sensory organization test (SOT) was performed in 6 conditions using computerized dynamic posturography, to assess postural control. Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P &lt; .05) and strategy scores (P &lt; .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P &lt; .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P &gt; .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.</td>\n",

       "0     Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p < 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.   \n",

The participants were assessed based on age, gender, dominant side, the amount of time they spent on their smartphones, the purpose of their use, and their posture. The Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Form (SAS-SF) was used to determine addictes and non-addicts. The cut-off value of SAS-SF is 31 and above for male and 33 and above for female.\\nResults: There were 136 participants in the study. The posture score for addicts and non-addicts ones was not significantly different (p > 0,05), but the number of trigger points, maximal bending posture and trigger points in the right levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles were significantly higher in the smartphone addict participants (p < 0,05).\\nConclusions: Smartphone addiction in university students is associated with postural changes and trigger points in the bilateral levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles. Public health programs should be developed to raise awareness about smartphone addiction, encourage screen breaks, and emphasize physical activity and exercise regularly.   \n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj < 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj < 0.05/4) for the Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the telerehabilitation training group, which included diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, was more effective in improving Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD in males with UCS.   \n",

A total of sixty-six eligible participants with chronic neck pain and forward head posture were randomized into the Myofascial Release Therapy (MRT) group (n = 33) and MRT and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) group (n = 33). Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group. The difference in outcomes between the groups was statistically significant. Myofascial Release Therapy combined with CBT is an effective treatment method for patients with chronic neck pain and forward head posture.   \n",

Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P < .05) and strategy scores (P < .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P < .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P > .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.   \n",

This lesion, untreated, may result in damage to the spinal cord, paresis or sudden death. Occipital headache, present in 13 of 22 patients, was often aggravated by working with the head in forward flexion. Paresthesias were present in six patients. The spine of the axis was often prominent. In three patients there was objective evidence of cord compression with sensory and/or pyramidal signs. In eight the lesion was asymptomatic and discovered by routine lateral radiography in flexion, the position of maximum subluxation.Conservative treatment involved the continuous use of a cervical collar to limit neck flexion. This usually relieved subjective symptoms including headaches. Successful surgical fixation was performed in two individuals. Surgical indications included acute or chronic cord compression or severe symptoms unrelieved by a collar.   \n",

Since positional nystagmus may be difficult to evoke and may be elicited at one time and not at another, it is important to make repeated tests, lest a causative lesion be overlooked. Vertigo in such cases may be caused by pathologic change in the eighth peripheral nerve or in the central vestibular pathways. Sometimes no organic disease is observable even though positional nystagmus validates a complaint of vertigo. In such instances the patient should be assured that he does not have a progressive disease and be advised against activity in which dizziness would be hazardous.   \n",

       "      <td>Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p &lt; 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: Forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture are common postural variants found in upper crossed syndrome, which can lead to limited neck mobility, respiratory problems, and other issues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p &lt; 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj &lt; 0.05/4) for the Rt.

Conclusions: These findings suggest that the telerehabilitation training group, which included diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, was more effective in improving Rt.

Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P &lt; .05) and strategy scores (P &lt; .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P &lt; .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P &gt; .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.</td>\n",

The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon was studied based on leg and trunk muscle activity (iEMG) and co-contraction ratio (CCR).\\nMethods: Forty-eight physically active and healthy adults were assigned to three groups, performing three oral motor tasks (jaw clenching, tongue pressing against the palate or habitual lower jaw position) during a dynamic one-legged stance reactive balance task on an oscillating platform. The iEMG and CCR of posture-relevant muscles and muscle pairs were analysed during platform forward acceleration.\\nResults: Tongue pressing caused an adjustment of co-contraction patterns of distal muscle groups based on changes in biomechanical coupling between the head and trunk during static balancing at the beginning of the experiment.

The aboriginal sample consisted of 42 young male adults from the Yuendumu settlement, Northern Territory, Australia. Cephalometric films of the natural head position were taken during a field trip to the settlement. The comparison comprised 18 postural and 61 morphological variables. In the aboriginals, the cervical column was shorter and had a less pronounced lordosis. The head was held about 3 degrees lower, and the upper cervical column was 8 1/2 degrees more forward inclined. As a consequence, the craniocervical angle was about 6 degrees larger. Comparison of the craniofacial morphology in the two groups showed in the aboriginals a shorter upper facial height, a larger anterior lower facial height, and a larger vertical jaw relationship (NL/ML). The length of the posterior cranial base, s-ba, was 4 mm shorter (P less than 0.001) in the aboriginals, possibly developmentally related to the generally shorter spinal column in Australian aboriginals.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Various types of disorders of the cervical region may produce headache. In many of these increased tension of the neck musculature plays an important role. The following mechanisms underlying headache are described and differentiated: 1. Headache due to faulty muscle pattern (stereotype) resulting in overstrain of the upper fixators of the shoulder girdle (upper part of the m.trapezius and levator scapulae); faulty respiration with the aid of the upper auxillary muscles even at rest is pointed out. 2. A forward drawn head position producing static overstrain in the posterior neck muscles and compensatory retroflexion of the cranio-cervical junction resulting in blockage in this region. 3. Anteflexion and ligament pain mainly due to faulty position at work and jolting. 4. Static disturbance in the frontal plain due to obliquity producing asymmetrical strain in the neck musculature. 5. Increased muscular tension due to psychological stress. 6. Blockage in the regions of the cervical spine, shoulder girdle and upper ribs with reflex muscular spasm. 7. Reflex spasm of the neck musculature in visceral disorders causing in addition blockage of the cervico-thoracic junction (heart, gall bladder). 8. Pain arising from the posterior arch of the atlas (here described for the first time). 9. Headache due to vertebral artery involvement. The type of headache seems to be determined rather by the individual mode of reaction than by the mechanism underlying it. As a rule a combination of mechanisms is actually found.</td>\n",

       "0     Background: Chronic neck pain (CNP) is a common public health problem that affects daily living activities and quality of life. There is biomechanical interdependence between the neck and scapula. Studies have shown that shoulder blade function might be related to chronic neck pain. We therefore evaluated the effects of scapular targeted therapy on neck pain and function in patients with CNP.\\nMethods: Databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus, were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published in English investigating treatment of the scapula for CNP before July 16, 2023.\\nResults: A total of 313 participants were included from 8 RCTs. Compared with those in the control group, the intervention in the scapular treatment group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.55; 95% CI = 0.97 to 4.13; P = 0.002), with moderate evidence. Subgroup analysis for pain intensity revealed a significant difference between the sexes, with only the female population (SMD = 6.23, 95% CI = 4.80 to 7.65) showing better outcomes than those with both sexes (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.56) (p < 0.00001). However, moderate evidence demonstrated no improvement in neck disability after scapular treatment (SMD of 0.24[-0.14, 0.62] of Neck Disability Index or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire). No effect of scapular treatment was shown on the pressure pain threshold (PPT). The cervical range of motion (CROM) and electromyographic activity of neck muscles could not be conclusively evaluated due to limited support in the articles, and further study was needed. However, the patient's head forward posture appeared to be corrected after scapular treatment.\\nConclusion: Scapular therapy was beneficial for relieving pain intensity in patients with CNP, especially in women. Head forward posture might also be corrected with scapular therapy. However, scapular therapy may have no effect on the PPT or neck disability. However, whether scapular therapy could improve CROM and cervical muscle activation in patients with CNPs had not been determined and needed further study.   \n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation, combining diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, on young men with upper crossed syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic over 4 weeks. Methods: The study included 37 participants aged in their 20s and 30s who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group received diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, while the control group only underwent shoulder stabilization exercises. Both groups were trained three times a week for four weeks using telerehabilitation. The comparison of within-group pre-post differences in the experimental and control groups was conducted using a paired t-test, while the effects of treatment were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: After 4 weeks, both groups showed significant improvements in the pain pressure threshold of the upper trapezius, craniovertebral angle, round shoulder posture, shoulder tilt degree, neck disability index, and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test (all p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between the Time effect (p adj < 0.05/4) for both sides of PPT, CVA, and STD and both sides of RSP, NDI, and CKCUEST, and an interaction between the Time × Group effects (p adj < 0.05/4) for the Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the telerehabilitation training group, which included diaphragmatic breathing re-education and shoulder stabilization exercises, was more effective in improving Rt. PPT, CVA, and STD in males with UCS.   \n",

A total of sixty-six eligible participants with chronic neck pain and forward head posture were randomized into the Myofascial Release Therapy (MRT) group (n = 33) and MRT and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) group (n = 33). Clinical outcomes included neck pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale, neck disability measured through the neck disability index, and forward head posture measured through the cranial vertebral angle. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and the four and eight weeks after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvement in pain intensity, CVA, and neck disability after the intervention. However, the CBT group demonstrated greater improvements than the MRT group. The difference in outcomes between the groups was statistically significant. Myofascial Release Therapy combined with CBT is an effective treatment method for patients with chronic neck pain and forward head posture.   \n",

Equilibrium scores representing overall balance, strategy analysis to assess ankle vs hip strategy dominance, and sensory analysis (Somatosensory, visual, vestibular, visual preference ratio) as an indicator of the use of sensory systems were obtained.\\nResults: Our results revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of equilibrium score (P < .05) and strategy scores (P < .05) in conditions of 4 to 6 of the SOT. The results of sensory analysis of SOT showed visual and vestibular ratios were significantly different between the 2 study groups (P < .05), but somatosensory and visual preference ratios were not significantly different between these 2 groups (P > .05).\\nConclusion: Individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP swayed more in comparison with mild FHP ones in conditions with the Sway-referenced platform of the SOT. They tended to rely on the hip strategy more than the ankle strategy excessively when sensory difficulty increased. Overall, it can be concluded that individuals with moderate-to-severe FHP are more likely to have postural deficits.   \n",

The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon was studied based on leg and trunk muscle activity (iEMG) and co-contraction ratio (CCR).\\nMethods: Forty-eight physically active and healthy adults were assigned to three groups, performing three oral motor tasks (jaw clenching, tongue pressing against the palate or habitual lower jaw position) during a dynamic one-legged stance reactive balance task on an oscillating platform. The iEMG and CCR of posture-relevant muscles and muscle pairs were analysed during platform forward acceleration.\\nResults: Tongue pressing caused an adjustment of co-contraction patterns of distal muscle groups based on changes in biomechanical coupling between the head and trunk during static balancing at the beginning of the experiment. Neither iEMG nor CCR measurement helped detect a general neuromuscular effect of jaw clenching on the dynamic reactive balance.\\nConclusion: The findings might indicate the existence of robust fixed patterns of rapid postural responses during the important initial phases of balance recovery.   \n",

It is conceivable that relative lengths of the cervical column might influence population differences in craniocervical posture and craniofacial morphology. The present study aimed to elucidate this relationship by comparing head posture and craniofacial morphology in Australian aboriginals to the same features in a previously studied sample of 120 Danish students (Solow and Tallgren, 1976). The aboriginal sample consisted of 42 young male adults from the Yuendumu settlement, Northern Territory, Australia. Cephalometric films of the natural head position were taken during a field trip to the settlement. The comparison comprised 18 postural and 61 morphological variables. In the aboriginals, the cervical column was shorter and had a less pronounced lordosis. The head was held about 3 degrees lower, and the upper cervical column was 8 1/2 degrees more forward inclined. As a consequence, the craniocervical angle was about 6 degrees larger. Comparison of the craniofacial morphology in the two groups showed in the aboriginals a shorter upper facial height, a larger anterior lower facial height, and a larger vertical jaw relationship (NL/ML). The length of the posterior cranial base, s-ba, was 4 mm shorter (P less than 0.001) in the aboriginals, possibly developmentally related to the generally shorter spinal column in Australian aboriginals.   \n",

Bilateral infusion of the GABA antagonists in the MRF-DLSC elicits compulsive gnawing and biting but not licking or sniffing. Infusion of GABA-receptor agonists (muscimol, THIP) in the MRF-DLSC while producing only minor or no motor or behavioural effects, drastically altered apomorphine effects; thus, unilateral infusion of muscimol resulted i tight, head-to-tail ipsiversive circling while bilateral infusion of muscimol converted the apomorphine-syndrome from stereotypy of high-intensity into pure compulsive forward locomotion devoid of sniffing. The results indicate that GABAergic mechanisms in the MRF-DLSC are of primary importance in the expression of motor and behavioural syndromes arising from the striatum.   \n",

In many of these increased tension of the neck musculature plays an important role. The following mechanisms underlying headache are described and differentiated: 1. Headache due to faulty muscle pattern (stereotype) resulting in overstrain of the upper fixators of the shoulder girdle (upper part of the m.trapezius and levator scapulae); faulty respiration with the aid of the upper auxillary muscles even at rest is pointed out. 2. A forward drawn head position producing static overstrain in the posterior neck muscles and compensatory retroflexion of the cranio-cervical junction resulting in blockage in this region. 3. Anteflexion and ligament pain mainly due to faulty position at work and jolting. 4. Static disturbance in the frontal plain due to obliquity producing asymmetrical strain in the neck musculature. 5. Increased muscular tension due to psychological stress. 6. Blockage in the regions of the cervical spine, shoulder girdle and upper ribs with reflex muscular spasm. 7. Reflex spasm of the neck musculature in visceral disorders causing in addition blockage of the cervico-thoracic junction (heart, gall bladder). 8. Pain arising from the posterior arch of the atlas (here described for the first time). 9. Headache due to vertebral artery involvement. The type of headache seems to be determined rather by the individual mode of reaction than by the mechanism underlying it. As a rule a combination of mechanisms is actually found.   \n",

Under the contingent music condition dropping the head forward automatically terminated the broadcast (music). A comparison of baseline and treatment phases showed that head orientation was strongly controlled by contingent music.   \n",

This hypothesis is examined in the light of the clinical evidence provided by the symptomatology and treatment of 19 consecutive cases of intracranial mass lesions exhibiting truncal ataxia.   \n",

       "      <td>Background: The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between smartphone addiction and miyafascial trigger points in university students.\\nMethods: A cross-sectional study of university students was conducted for the purpose of this study. The participants were assessed based on age, gender, dominant side, the amount of time they spent on their smartphones, the purpose of their use, and their posture. The Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Form (SAS-SF) was used to determine addictes and non-addicts. The cut-off value of SAS-SF is 31 and above for male and 33 and above for female.\\nResults: There were 136 participants in the study. The posture score for addicts and non-addicts ones was not significantly different (p &gt; 0,05), but the number of trigger points, maximal bending posture and trigger points in the right levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles were significantly higher in the smartphone addict participants (p &lt; 0,05).\\nConclusions: Smartphone addiction in university students is associated with postural changes and trigger points in the bilateral levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles. Public health programs should be developed to raise awareness about smartphone addiction, encourage screen breaks, and emphasize physical activity and exercise regularly.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: Neck and jaw pain is common and is associated with jaw functional limitations, postural stability, muscular endurance, and proprioception. This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength.

       "      <td>Purpose: With the increasing level of automation in automobiles, the advent of autonomous vehicles has reduced the tendency of drivers and passengers to focus on the task of driving. The increasing automation in automobiles reduced the drivers' and passengers' focus on driving, which allowed occupants to choose a more relaxed and comfortable sitting position. Meanwhile, the occupant's sitting position went from a frontal, upright position to a more relaxed and reclined one, which resulted in the existing restraint systems can not to keep occupants safe and secure. This study aimed to determine the effects of different reclining states on occupants' lumbar and neck injuries.\\nMethods: This is an original research on the field of automotive safety engineering. Occupants in different initial seating positions (25°, 35°, 45°, and 55°) were adapted to changes in seat back angle and restraint systems and placed in the same frontal impact environment. Neck injury indexes, lumbar axial compression force and acceleration, as well as occupant dynamic response during the impact, were compared in different seating positions. The injury response and kinematic characteristics of occupants in different reclining positions were analyzed by the control variable method.\\nResults: As the sitting angle increased, the occupant's head acceleration decreased, and the forward-lean angle decreased. Occupants in the standard sitting position had the greatest neck injury, with an Nij of 0.95, and were susceptible to abbreviated injury scale 2+ cervical medullary injuries. As the seatback angle increased, the geometric position of the lumbar spine tended to be horizontal, and the impact load transmitted greater forces to the lumbar spine. The occupant's lumbar injury was greatest in the lying position, with a peak axial compression force on the lumbar region of 5.5 KN, which was 2.3 KN greater than in the standard sitting position.\\nConclusion: The study of occupant lumbar and neck injuries based on different recline states can provide a theoretical basis for optimizing lumbar evaluation indexes, which is conducive to the understanding of the lumbar injury mechanism and the comprehensive consideration of occupant safety protection.</td>\n",

Studies have shown that poor posture habits can impair muscle function during craniofacial growth and development. A muscle imbalance causes abnormal positioning of dental and skeletal structures, a condition that exerts negative impacts, such as changes in facial morphology.\\nObjective: To determine through photometric analysis the relationship between craniovertebral angle as a function of head posture and glabella-subnasale-pogonion (G-Sn-Pg) angle as a function of facial profile in 10-12-year-old children, and the results will help to avoid facial development issues.\\nMethods: Thirty-three subjects met the inclusion criteria. Their craniovertebral angles and facial profiles were measured using lateral photometry and ImageJ. The craniovertebral angle was determined by connecting the tragus and C7 with a horizontal line, whereas the facial profile angle was determined by connecting the glabella, subnasale, and pogonion. The relationship between the craniovertebral and G-Sn-Pg angle values was analyzed using the Pearson correlation test.\\nResults: A significant relationship was observed between the craniovertebral angle and the G-Sn- Pg angle (p &lt; 0.05), although such a relationship was weak (r = 0.373).\\nConclusion: A more forward head posture is associated with a more convex facial profile, and this relationship is useful for the early prevention and treatment.</td>\n",

Steady yaw rate (circularvection) and development of a constant roll tilt angle, for the head erect and constant velocity yaw and roll stimuli, confirmed previous reports. Pitch stimuli also were found to produce a sensation of tilting to a steady pitch angle, which was much stronger for pitch forward than backward. Pitch and roll effects were strongly dependent on head position, increasing for the head rolled 90 degrees to the side or inverted, and decreasing for the head pitched 25 degrees forward.

The participants were assessed based on age, gender, dominant side, the amount of time they spent on their smartphones, the purpose of their use, and their posture. The Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Form (SAS-SF) was used to determine addictes and non-addicts. The cut-off value of SAS-SF is 31 and above for male and 33 and above for female.\\nResults: There were 136 participants in the study. The posture score for addicts and non-addicts ones was not significantly different (p > 0,05), but the number of trigger points, maximal bending posture and trigger points in the right levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles were significantly higher in the smartphone addict participants (p < 0,05).\\nConclusions: Smartphone addiction in university students is associated with postural changes and trigger points in the bilateral levator scapula and right cervical erector muscles. Public health programs should be developed to raise awareness about smartphone addiction, encourage screen breaks, and emphasize physical activity and exercise regularly.   \n",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of jaw and neck pain on craniocervico- mandibular functions and postural stability in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs).\\nMethods: Fifty-two patients with TMJDs were included and assessed using Fonseca's Questionnaire and the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index. An isometric strength test was performed for the TMJ depressor and cervical muscles. The TMJ position sense (TMJPS) test and cervical joint position error test (CJPET) were employed for proprioception. Total sway degree was obtained for the assessment of postural stability. Deep neck flexor endurance (DNFE) was assessed using the craniocervical flexion test. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was employed to assess mandibular function, and the craniovertebral angle (CVA) was measured for forward head posture.\\nResults: Jaw and neck pain negatively affected CVA (R2 = 0.130), TMJPS (R2 = 0.286), DNFE (R2 = 0.355), TMJ depressor (R2 = 0.145), cervical flexor (R2 = 0.144), and extensor (R2 = 0.148) muscle strength. Jaw and neck pain also positively affected CJPET for flexion (R2 = 0.116) and extension (R2 = 0.146), as well as total sway degree (R2 = 0.128) and MFIQ (R2 = 0.230).\\nConclusions: Patients with painful TMJDs, could have impaired muscle strength and proprioception of the TMJ and cervical region. The jaw and neck pain could also affect postural stability, and the endurance of deep neck flexors as well as mandibular functions in TMJDs.   \n",

These changes in muscular and connective tissues can impair cervical spine stability and contribute to developing neck pain symptoms. In this experiment, change in the cervical spine stability associated with a sustained smartphone use posture was evaluated by quantifying the effective stiffness and the reflexive responses of the head to sudden perturbations. Seventeen young smartphone users maintained their heads tilted forward approximately 30° for 30 min while watching videos on their smartphones in sitting. Data show that the measures of cervical spine stability did not change significantly after the smartphone use task despite developing mild to moderate neck and upper body discomfort symptoms. Study findings imply that keeping the head tilt posture for 30 min for smartphone use did not significantly alter spinal stability, rejecting its association with neck discomfort.   \n",
       "8     Purpose: With the increasing level of automation in automobiles, the advent of autonomous vehicles has reduced the tendency of drivers and passengers to focus on the task of driving. The increasing automation in automobiles reduced the drivers' and passengers' focus on driving, which allowed occupants to choose a more relaxed and comfortable sitting position. Meanwhile, the occupant's sitting position went from a frontal, upright position to a more relaxed and reclined one, which resulted in the existing restraint systems can not to keep occupants safe and secure. This study aimed to determine the effects of different reclining states on occupants' lumbar and neck injuries.\\nMethods: This is an original research on the field of automotive safety engineering. Occupants in different initial seating positions (25°, 35°, 45°, and 55°) were adapted to changes in seat back angle and restraint systems and placed in the same frontal impact environment. Neck injury indexes, lumbar axial compression force and acceleration, as well as occupant dynamic response during the impact, were compared in different seating positions. The injury response and kinematic characteristics of occupants in different reclining positions were analyzed by the control variable method.\\nResults: As the sitting angle increased, the occupant's head acceleration decreased, and the forward-lean angle decreased. Occupants in the standard sitting position had the greatest neck injury, with an Nij of 0.95, and were susceptible to abbreviated injury scale 2+ cervical medullary injuries. As the seatback angle increased, the geometric position of the lumbar spine tended to be horizontal, and the impact load transmitted greater forces to the lumbar spine. The occupant's lumbar injury was greatest in the lying position, with a peak axial compression force on the lumbar region of 5.5 KN, which was 2.3 KN greater than in the standard sitting position.\\nConclusion: The study of occupant lumbar and neck injuries based on different recline states can provide a theoretical basis for optimizing lumbar evaluation indexes, which is conducive to the understanding of the lumbar injury mechanism and the comprehensive consideration of occupant safety protection.   \n",

Studies have shown that poor posture habits can impair muscle function during craniofacial growth and development. A muscle imbalance causes abnormal positioning of dental and skeletal structures, a condition that exerts negative impacts, such as changes in facial morphology.\\nObjective: To determine through photometric analysis the relationship between craniovertebral angle as a function of head posture and glabella-subnasale-pogonion (G-Sn-Pg) angle as a function of facial profile in 10-12-year-old children, and the results will help to avoid facial development issues.\\nMethods: Thirty-three subjects met the inclusion criteria. Their craniovertebral angles and facial profiles were measured using lateral photometry and ImageJ. The craniovertebral angle was determined by connecting the tragus and C7 with a horizontal line, whereas the facial profile angle was determined by connecting the glabella, subnasale, and pogonion. The relationship between the craniovertebral and G-Sn-Pg angle values was analyzed using the Pearson correlation test.\\nResults: A significant relationship was observed between the craniovertebral angle and the G-Sn- Pg angle (p < 0.05), although such a relationship was weak (r = 0.373).\\nConclusion: A more forward head posture is associated with a more convex facial profile, and this relationship is useful for the early prevention and treatment.   \n",

This causes a greater resistance when trying to open the hypopharynx with the esophagoscope. If, however, the head is held forward, this resistance will be considerably reduced.   \n",

Squirrel monkeys showed similar findings to cats, in which vertical optokinetic nystagmus (VOKN) is not as well elicited as horizontal optokinetic nystagmus (HOKN) and down-pursuit OKN is poorer than up-pursuit OKN. As to the reasons that bring about different responses of OKN and OKAN (and vestibular nystagmus) in different planes, we speculated two possibilities: compensatory activation of horizontal eye movement for narrowed visual field accompanied by frontally positioned eyes, and the gravity that restricts and modifies posture and locomotion. Directional difference of VOKN may be caused by a physiological mechanism that makes visual fixation not susceptible to downward movement of the ground surface during forward locomotion.   \n",

Despite the classical conception (Lutkens) of gall bladders invariably oblique, it showed that some are vertical, horizontal or even descending. Contrary to this classical conception which describes the infundibulum and cystic ducts as being oblique from the front backwards in the same direction as the long axis of an oblique gall bladder, these lateral views showed that, whilst the infundibulum may continue in the same direction as the long axis of the gall bladder, the same does not apply to the neck and cystic duct. They run from behind forwards and almost always in the direction of feet to head of the subject. Very rarely the neck is directed from head to foot. In addition, and once again contrary to Lukens description, the common bile duct is not the most posterior of the parts of the biliary tree. It is the infundibulocervical region which is the most inclined, regardless of the type of gall bladder. These lateral views also made it possible to demonstrate the pathognomic appearances of hypotonic and hypertonix hepatic/bile ducts and the antero-posterior projecting movements of the main bile duct.   \n",

A full field (360 degrees) flight simulator projection system was used to investigate the sensations resulting from pitch, roll, and yaw stimuli at various head orientations. Steady yaw rate (circularvection) and development of a constant roll tilt angle, for the head erect and constant velocity yaw and roll stimuli, confirmed previous reports. Pitch stimuli also were found to produce a sensation of tilting to a steady pitch angle, which was much stronger for pitch forward than backward. Pitch and roll effects were strongly dependent on head position, increasing for the head rolled 90 degrees to the side or inverted, and decreasing for the head pitched 25 degrees forward. These results support a hypothesis that visually induced tilt is limited by conflict with otolith information.   \n",

       "      <td>2024 Feb</td>\n",
       "      <td>Background: Traditional testing prior to return to sport following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction typically involves jump-landing tasks in the forward direction. As injury is most likely the result of multiplanar neuromuscular control deficits, assessment of dynamic postural stability using landing tasks that require multiplanar stabilization may be more appropriate. The purpose of this study was to examine how dynamic postural stability is affected when performing jump-landing tasks in three different directions.\\nMethods: Fifteen athletes [11 females (18.0 ± 3.0 years) and 4 males (18.5 ± 3.1 years)] following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed a series of single-limb jump-landing tasks in 3 directions. Individual directional stability indices and a composite dynamic postural stability index were calculated using ground reaction force data and were compared using separate one-way repeated measures ANOVAs.\\nFindings: All directional stability indices demonstrated a significant main effect for jump-landing direction (medial-lateral P &lt; 0.001, η2p = 0.95; anterior-posterior P &lt; 0.001, η2p = 0.97; vertical P = 0.021, η2p = 0.24). The diagonal jump-landing direction produced increased medial-lateral stability and vertical stability scores, while the forward and diagonal jump-landing directions produced increased anterior-posterior stability scores. There was no significant effect for the composite dynamic stability index score.\\nInterpretation: Jump-landing direction affects dynamic postural stability in all 3 planes of movement in athletes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Results indicate the potential need to incorporate multiple jump-landing directions to better assess dynamic postural stability prior to return to sport.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Objective: Unilateral mastectomy is known to induce postural alterations, yet the temporal development pattern of these changes remains elusive. This study aimed to explore the impact of unilateral mastectomy on body posture.\\nMethods: A prospective, longitudinal, observational study with a one-group repeated-measures design was conducted. Patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy were recruited from a university-affiliated hospital in Western China and monitored for 12 months post-surgery. A trained nurse assessed seven postural baseline parameters on the day of suture removal and at 3, 6, and 12 months after unilateral mastectomy. Two parameters were in the sagittal plane (forward head posture and trunk rotation angle), and five were in the coronal plane (neck tilt, shoulder asymmetry, scapular asymmetry, scapular asymmetry relative to the spine, and pelvic tilt).\\nResults: The final analysis included 159 patients. Baseline prevalence of most postural abnormalities ranged from 50.94% to 59.75%, with mean deviations between 2.74 and 4.51 mm. At 12 months post-mastectomy, prevalence and mean deviations increased by more than 30% and 3.50 mm, respectively, compared to baseline. Postural abnormalities increased gradually in the first 3 months, notably between the 3rd and 6th months, and slowed between the 6th and 12th months. On the mastectomy side, coronal plane abnormalities significantly increased within 12 months: earlobe to acromion distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P &lt; 0.001), depressed shoulder height (Wald χ2 = 42.253, P &lt; 0.001), depressed scapula height (Wald χ2 = 31.587, P &lt; 0.001), scapula to spine distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P &lt; 0.001), and elevated pelvic height (Wald χ2 = 48.924, P &lt; 0.001).\\nConclusions: Postural changes are common post-unilateral mastectomy, with prevalence and deviation increasing gradually, particularly between 3 and 6 months post-mastectomy. Early rehabilitation initiation is recommended to mitigate postural changes.\\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2000040897.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Objectives This paper attempts to use machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict the presence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in a patient based on their body habitus, craniofacial anatomy, and social history. Materials and methods Data from a group of 69 adult patients who attended a dental clinic for oral surgeries and dental procedures in the last 10 years was used to train machine-learning models to predict whether a subject is likely to have SDB based on input information such as age, gender, smoking history, body mass index (BMI), oropharyngeal airway (Mallampati assessment), forward head posture (FHP), facial skeletal pattern, and sleep quality. Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest Neighbours (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB) were selected as these are the most frequently used supervised machine-learning models for classification of outcomes. The data was split into two sets for machine training (80% of total records) and the remaining was used for testing (validation). Results Initial analysis of collected data showed overweight BMI (at 25 or above), periorbital hyperchromia (dark circle eyes), nasal deviation, micrognathia, convex facial skeletal pattern (class 2) and Mallampati class 2 or above have positive correlations with SDB. Logistic Regression was found to be the best performer amongst the four models used with an accuracy of 86%, F1 score of 88% and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 93%. LR also had 100% specificity and 77.8% sensitivity. Support Vector Machine was the second-best performer with an accuracy of 79%, F1 score of 82% and AUC of 93%. k-Nearest Neighbours and Naïve Bayes performed reasonably well with F1 scores of 71% and 67%, respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated the feasibility of using simple machine-learning models as a credible predictor of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with structural risk factors for sleep apnoea such as craniofacial anomalies, neck posture and soft tissue airway obstruction. By utilising higher-level machine-learning algorithms, it is possible to incorporate a broader range of risk factors, including non-structural features like respiratory diseases, asthma, medication use, and more, into the prediction model.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A simplified test for anterolateral rotary subluxation of the knee is largely based on the concepts described by Galway and McIntosh although performed in a different manner. The examiner places the right hand gently on the lateral side of the knee with the thumb overlying the posterior aspect of the fibula and the index finger palpating the anterolateral aspect of the joint line to determine the the tibiofemoral relationship. The left hand embraces the lateral side of the distal end of the femur with the thumb over the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. With equal pressure on the lateral femoral condyle and fibular head the knee is pushed gently forward into flexion. When anterointernal tibial luxation is present, a reduction phenomenon is felt as the knee passes into the 25 to 40 degree flexion range. This may occur as a sudden palpable and occasionally audible repositioning which is responsible for such terminology as a \"pivot shift\" or \"jerk sign.\" We have experienced many instances where the reduction phenomenon is more subtle and is determined by palpation alone. The pathologic mechanics are determined by observations at surgery in 45 patients with a positive test. This test has improved our diagnositc ability and is easly taught to those unfamiliar with knee joint disorders.</td>\n",

There is a strong association between temporomandibular disorders and forward head syndrome. Where the muscular component is the main affected, with the appearance of more trigger points at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscles, upper trapezius, rectus capitis posterior and upper oblique capitis. Degenerative changes in the temporomandibular joint have been observed, but evidence is still lacking to ensure that Forward Head Syndrome is the etiological factor.   \n",

As injury is most likely the result of multiplanar neuromuscular control deficits, assessment of dynamic postural stability using landing tasks that require multiplanar stabilization may be more appropriate. The purpose of this study was to examine how dynamic postural stability is affected when performing jump-landing tasks in three different directions.\\nMethods: Fifteen athletes [11 females (18.0 ± 3.0 years) and 4 males (18.5 ± 3.1 years)] following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed a series of single-limb jump-landing tasks in 3 directions. Individual directional stability indices and a composite dynamic postural stability index were calculated using ground reaction force data and were compared using separate one-way repeated measures ANOVAs.\\nFindings: All directional stability indices demonstrated a significant main effect for jump-landing direction (medial-lateral P < 0.001, η2p = 0.95; anterior-posterior P < 0.001, η2p = 0.97; vertical P = 0.021, η2p = 0.24). The diagonal jump-landing direction produced increased medial-lateral stability and vertical stability scores, while the forward and diagonal jump-landing directions produced increased anterior-posterior stability scores. There was no significant effect for the composite dynamic stability index score.\\nInterpretation: Jump-landing direction affects dynamic postural stability in all 3 planes of movement in athletes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Results indicate the potential need to incorporate multiple jump-landing directions to better assess dynamic postural stability prior to return to sport.   \n",

This study aimed to explore the impact of unilateral mastectomy on body posture.\\nMethods: A prospective, longitudinal, observational study with a one-group repeated-measures design was conducted. Patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy were recruited from a university-affiliated hospital in Western China and monitored for 12 months post-surgery. A trained nurse assessed seven postural baseline parameters on the day of suture removal and at 3, 6, and 12 months after unilateral mastectomy. Two parameters were in the sagittal plane (forward head posture and trunk rotation angle), and five were in the coronal plane (neck tilt, shoulder asymmetry, scapular asymmetry, scapular asymmetry relative to the spine, and pelvic tilt).\\nResults: The final analysis included 159 patients. Baseline prevalence of most postural abnormalities ranged from 50.94% to 59.75%, with mean deviations between 2.74 and 4.51 mm. At 12 months post-mastectomy, prevalence and mean deviations increased by more than 30% and 3.50 mm, respectively, compared to baseline. Postural abnormalities increased gradually in the first 3 months, notably between the 3rd and 6th months, and slowed between the 6th and 12th months. On the mastectomy side, coronal plane abnormalities significantly increased within 12 months: earlobe to acromion distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P < 0.001), depressed shoulder height (Wald χ2 = 42.253, P < 0.001), depressed scapula height (Wald χ2 = 31.587, P < 0.001), scapula to spine distance (Wald χ2 = 45.283, P < 0.001), and elevated pelvic height (Wald χ2 = 48.924, P < 0.001).\\nConclusions: Postural changes are common post-unilateral mastectomy, with prevalence and deviation increasing gradually, particularly between 3 and 6 months post-mastectomy. Early rehabilitation initiation is recommended to mitigate postural changes.\\nTrial registration: ChiCTR2000040897.   \n",

However, it is not clear whether laryngeal narrowing occurs as a compensatory response to tracheal movement or is affected by posture. Here, we report the case of an advanced COPD patient whose more prolonged expiration in a head-forward leaning position compared with that in a neck-extended position occurred with an excessive duration of severe laryngeal narrowing without tracheal obstruction, which led to exercise intolerance with expiratory mechanical constraints. This case provided useful insights into the regulation of the upper airway with body positioning for improving exercise tolerance.   \n",
       "68    Objectives This paper attempts to use machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict the presence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in a patient based on their body habitus, craniofacial anatomy, and social history. Materials and methods Data from a group of 69 adult patients who attended a dental clinic for oral surgeries and dental procedures in the last 10 years was used to train machine-learning models to predict whether a subject is likely to have SDB based on input information such as age, gender, smoking history, body mass index (BMI), oropharyngeal airway (Mallampati assessment), forward head posture (FHP), facial skeletal pattern, and sleep quality. Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest Neighbours (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB) were selected as these are the most frequently used supervised machine-learning models for classification of outcomes. The data was split into two sets for machine training (80% of total records) and the remaining was used for testing (validation). Results Initial analysis of collected data showed overweight BMI (at 25 or above), periorbital hyperchromia (dark circle eyes), nasal deviation, micrognathia, convex facial skeletal pattern (class 2) and Mallampati class 2 or above have positive correlations with SDB. Logistic Regression was found to be the best performer amongst the four models used with an accuracy of 86%, F1 score of 88% and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 93%. LR also had 100% specificity and 77.8% sensitivity. Support Vector Machine was the second-best performer with an accuracy of 79%, F1 score of 82% and AUC of 93%. k-Nearest Neighbours and Naïve Bayes performed reasonably well with F1 scores of 71% and 67%, respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated the feasibility of using simple machine-learning models as a credible predictor of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with structural risk factors for sleep apnoea such as craniofacial anomalies, neck posture and soft tissue airway obstruction. By utilising higher-level machine-learning algorithms, it is possible to incorporate a broader range of risk factors, including non-structural features like respiratory diseases, asthma, medication use, and more, into the prediction model.   \n",

The examiner places the right hand gently on the lateral side of the knee with the thumb overlying the posterior aspect of the fibula and the index finger palpating the anterolateral aspect of the joint line to determine the the tibiofemoral relationship. The left hand embraces the lateral side of the distal end of the femur with the thumb over the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. With equal pressure on the lateral femoral condyle and fibular head the knee is pushed gently forward into flexion. When anterointernal tibial luxation is present, a reduction phenomenon is felt as the knee passes into the 25 to 40 degree flexion range. This may occur as a sudden palpable and occasionally audible repositioning which is responsible for such terminology as a \"pivot shift\" or \"jerk sign.\" We have experienced many instances where the reduction phenomenon is more subtle and is determined by palpation alone. The pathologic mechanics are determined by observations at surgery in 45 patients with a positive test. This test has improved our diagnositc ability and is easly taught to those unfamiliar with knee joint disorders.   \n",

Videotape analysis of 300 simultaneously recorded electroencephalographic and clinical attacks revealed 8- to 9-Hz 150 to 200 muV sharp waves beginning in both medial temporal areas during eyelid flutters. When discharges spread diffusely on both sides and lasted 2 to 3 sec, 20 degrees forward flexion of the head, unconsciousness, pupil dilation, and staring became evident. Asymmetrical myoclonic jerks invariably appeared. When paroxysms were greater than 3 sec, automatisms and tonic posturing occurred. The electroencephalographic and clinical seizures appeared during the awake and relaxed states, i.e., with normal alpha rhythm. They were suppressed during physical and mental activities and during sleep, i.e., in the absence of alpha rhythm. Our studies suggest that these seizures associated with diffuse electroencephalographic alpha-like activities are subcortical in origin and should be tested in their responsivity to alpha suppressants and inducers.   \n",

This lesion, untreated, may result in damage to the spinal cord, paresis or sudden death. Occipital headache, present in 13 of 22 patients, was often aggravated by working with the head in forward flexion. Paresthesias were present in six patients. The spine of the axis was often prominent. In three patients there was objective evidence of cord compression with sensory and/or pyramidal signs. In eight the lesion was asymptomatic and discovered by routine lateral radiography in flexion, the position of maximum subluxation.Conservative treatment involved the continuous use of a cervical collar to limit neck flexion. This usually relieved subjective symptoms including headaches. Successful surgical fixation was performed in two individuals. Surgical indications included acute or chronic cord compression or severe symptoms unrelieved by a collar.   \n",

Since positional nystagmus may be difficult to evoke and may be elicited at one time and not at another, it is important to make repeated tests, lest a causative lesion be overlooked. Vertigo in such cases may be caused by pathologic change in the eighth peripheral nerve or in the central vestibular pathways. Sometimes no organic disease is observable even though positional nystagmus validates a complaint of vertigo. In such instances the patient should be assured that he does not have a progressive disease and be advised against activity in which dizziness would be hazardous.   \n",
